# 👥 Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques to help businesses understand different groups of customers based on purchasing behavior and other key metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Analyze customer data to discover distinct segments
- Understand customer purchasing patterns and behaviors
- Support marketing strategy, personalization, and targeting
- Provide actionable insights for business growth and customer retention

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Imported the dataset using `pandas`
   - Explored data structure, data types, and summary statistics

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant features
   - Performed necessary data type conversions

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features relevant for segmentation (e.g., recency, frequency, monetary value)

4. **Scaling and Preprocessing**
   - Normalized/standardized data to prepare for clustering

5. **Clustering**
   - Applied K-Means clustering
   - Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
   - Assigned cluster labels to customers

6. **Visualization**
   - Visualized customer clusters using scatter plots and cluster centers
   - Interpreted each segment based on key characteristics

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas** – Data loading and manipulation  
- **numpy** – Numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning (KMeans, scaling)

✅ **Outcome**

Identified distinct customer segments based on behavioral features

Gained insight into high-value, low-value, and occasional customers
